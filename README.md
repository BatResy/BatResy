- Custom Systems, Lore, and uh...Cool Stuff™  

**Inspired By:**  
- *SCP: Secret Laboratory (kinda, barely. like 2%)*

## 📚 Currently Learning
- 🐍 **Python** – ez scripting ( i already learned this but not by heart yet )
- 🖥️ **C** – for OS/dev stuff (ARM kernel cooking soon)  
- ⚙️ **C++** – because why not suffer 💔  
- 🦀 **Rust** – memory-safe and cool

- Probably drawing random concepts at 5am
